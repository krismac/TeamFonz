# TeamFonz
Group Project to practice using JavaScript/ Java to make a web based Professional Development Award (PDA) Submission application app.

## TeamFonz consisted of 
- Genna Walsh (genocw)
- Graham Stein (Graham-Stein)
- Kris Mac (krismac)

# Specification
CodeClan instructors required that we establish a project to create an application in 5 days (during Week 15 of CodeClan) using core Java & Javascript with frameworks.

## Professional Development Academic Evidence Submission App
- PDAEEEEE Submission App

We agreed that there was a opportunity for a PDA submission app:
```
BRIEF

Problem statement
You have been approached by a private Academic institution dealing with an externally 
accredited professional award. Your task is to build an evidence submission 
app to help users collate their documentation in line with the syllabus.  
The institution are seeking to encourage more users undertaken 
activities as they go through the programme and have an opportunity to identify problem areas. 

Problem summary
- Timings - teaching schedule/ language
- User Friendly formatting
- Personal Schedule 
- Report Progress
- Submit Github
- Show where there are blocked items


Out of scope:
Cohort management
```

## Development
We self organised around 4 sprints, focusing on particular features and functionality within the days. The days were kicked off with a stand-up to support retrospective and re-planning and closed our day with a huddle and code remerges. Our trello/kanban dynamically compared our MoSCoW requirements with our backlog/work breakdown status

Our first exercise involved a short burst of independent research followed by a brainstorming session to determine core functionality (MVP) and data sources/approaches. The remainder of sprint 1 involved agreeing user journey/requirements and work breakdown along with laying groundwork such as creating a workflow to support code management around Github.
